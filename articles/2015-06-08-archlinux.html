<p class="date">June 8, 2015</p>
<p>Okay, so it’s been a minute. Let me get you caught up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I postponed my chess project. I got everything working minus the FINAL method, "checkmate?" It’s surprisingly difficult. I decided to move onto Rails. I intend to come back to this project someday and knock it out of the park</li>
  <li>So far Rails has been fun. MVC and all that.</li>
  <li>Real life got in the way and I had to switch laptops. I also got behind on coding for a few days.</li>
  <li>I decided to install Arch Linux onto my new Lenovo T420 laptop. I’ve never run Linux before, so Arch has definitely been a shocker for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you know anything about Arch Linux, you’ll know that it’s about as barebones as it gets when it comes to Operating Systems. I installed it because I’d read it’s a good OS for performance, and I’ve been thinking about making the switch to Linux for a while now. Arch was definitely like jumping into the deep end of the pool, but I feel like I’ve learned a lot in the past two days it’s taken to set it all up.</p>
<p>Plus, I’ve finally pulled my development out of the cloud and onto my actual machine. Developing in the cloud was neat and it worked really well for the most part, but I certainly ran into snags here and there. While it’s a neat concept and something that I think will be big in the future, I’m glad to have my development process firmly planted on the ground for now.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve decided to start my Hartl Rails Project over from scratch since I hadn’t gotten that far into it anyway and my brain has been switched out of Rails-mode for the past few days.</p>
<p>That's about it!</p>
