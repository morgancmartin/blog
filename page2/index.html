<p class="date">June 8, 2015</p>
<p>Okay, so it’s been a minute. Let me get you caught up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I postponed my chess project. I got everything working minus the FINAL method, "checkmate?" It’s surprisingly difficult. I decided to move onto Rails. I intend to come back to this project someday and knock it out of the park</li>
  <li>So far Rails has been fun. MVC and all that.</li>
  <li>Real life got in the way and I had to switch laptops. I also got behind on coding for a few days.</li>
  <li>I decided to install Arch Linux onto my new Lenovo T420 laptop. I’ve never run Linux before, so Arch has definitely been a shocker for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you know anything about Arch Linux, you’ll know that it’s about as barebones as it gets when it comes to Operating Systems. I installed it because I’d read it’s a good OS for performance, and I’ve been thinking about making the switch to Linux for a while now. Arch was definitely like jumping into the deep end of the pool, but I feel like I’ve learned a lot in the past two days it’s taken to set it all up.</p></section>
          
            <section class="article-preview"><a href="../articles/2015-05-19-chess.html"><h1>Chess</h1></a>
<p class="date">May 19, 2015</p>
<p>Okay, so chess isn’t going to take a week. I started working on it yesterday, and despite not having much time for it today, I’m already getting pretty close. I’ve got my board class and piece class mostly setup and I’m beginning on my game class now, so I should have it finished tomorrow if all goes well.</p>
<p>Chess is really interesting/fun! I’ve made a point of not cheating off anyone else’s code, so that I can be sure that I’m ready for Rails. Then again, I did install a neat gem called Colored, that just helps me color a given string in the command line. I could have done that on my own, but it looked a little tedious, plus gems are still part of the whole thing anyway, maaaaann.</p>
<p>Oh, and I also caught myself up on Git and all of it’s features. It’s still got a lot of mystical-seeming functionality, but I’ve got a much better understanding of what it’s doing, and why it’s important, so I’m happy with my bare-bones knowledge for now.</p>
<p>That’s about it!</p></section>
