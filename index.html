            <section><h1>Preparations</h1>
<p class="date">June 17, 2016</p>
<p>So I’ve got less than a month until my time at Viking Code School truly begins. For better or worse, I’ve been spending much of my time working through SICP.</p>
<p>SICP, or the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, is a wonderful book. Originally used as the primary text for MIT’s Intro to CompSci course, it has come to be known as the de facto book for broadening one’s computer science horizons. The top two reviews on its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/product-reviews/0262510871/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_summary?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=helpful">Amazon page</a>are by Peter Norvig (Director of Research at Google) and Paul Graham (Viaweb co-founder, Y Combinator co-founder) and they both give the book five stars. And while I simply don’t have enough time to work through the entire book before the beginning of VCS, I have been reading through each section as a way to introduce myself to topics like concurrency, streams and meta-linguistic programming. And then there’s Scheme.</p>
<p>Scheme is the programming language used in conjunction with SICP. The history of the language is actually very interesting. See, Scheme is technically a ‘dialect’ of the family of programming languages called Lisp. If that sounds strange that’s because it is. The original Lisp language was originally invented as a programmatic take on lambda calculus by John McCarthy, widely considered one of the “founding fathers” of artificial intelligence. About a decade later, Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman created the Scheme dialect. Sussman went on to write SICP and teach the course at MIT, meaning Scheme(and Lisp) is heavily rooted in the roots of Computer Science.</p>
<p>As for the why the language is such a big deal, Paul Graham has written extensively on the virtues of Lisp over on his <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html">website</a>. He even describes how the language gave him a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">major competitive edge</a>when he was developing his startup, Viaweb, which sold to Yahoo! for about 50 million dollars in 1998 and was re-dubbed Yahoo! Store. Suffice to say, Lisp is a compsci nerd’s wet dream.</p>
<p>From my relatively naive standpoint, I think giving some attention to some of the fundamental computer science topics is a good idea. I recently read an article by a startup called Triplebyte, a startup that helps engineers find jobs at other startups. <a href="http://blog.triplebyte.com/bootcamps-vs-college">In the article</a>, they discussed the dichotomy between the abilities of CS majors and those of bootcampers in terms of aceing a technical interview. Their findings boiled down to bootcampers doing better than average in web systems design while CS students did better than average in algorithms and data structures. And that seems to check out since bootcampers typically focus on practical knowledge while CS students tend to cover abstract concepts more thoroughly. Which brings me back to SICP — my hope is that its heavy focus on the fundamentals will help me shore up areas that VCS may not cover as thoroughly.</p>
<p>Practicality aside, it is certainly interesting material.</p>
<p>P.S. Here’s a particularly bad-ass note from the book’s section on concurrency:</p>
<p class="quote">“The basic phenomenon here is that synchronizing different processes, establishing shared state, or imposing an order on events requires communication among the processes. In essence, any notion of time in concurrency control must be intimately tied to communication. It is intriguing that a similar connection between time and communication also arises in the Theory of Relativity, where the speed of light (the fastest signal that can be used to synchronize events) is a fundamental constant relating time and space. The complexities we encounter in dealing with time and state in our computational models may in fact mirror a fundamental complexity of the physical universe.”</p>

            <section><h1>A Quick Guide to Creating a Personal Website</h1>
<h2>From Html to Hosting</h2>
<p class="date">June 10, 2016</p>
<p>Have you ever stumbled upon someone’s awesome looking personal website, and thought, “Wow, that looks great! I really need to get around to making my own sometime…?” Well it’s your lucky day, because I’m here to walk you through the process from start to finish, and it should only take you about a day to do.</p>
<p>What, still not convinced? Okay, let’s review some of the reasons why having a personal website is such a swell idea. For one, it’s your own personal platform, from which you can touch on any topic you like. For instance, say you like football. You can make a blog about your favorite players. Or you could go a little further, and host your own fantasy football application that you wrote. The cool part is that no matter what you can dream up, (and find/build) you can host on the world wide web where others can find it.</p>
<p>Of course, most of us just want one to represent ourselves on the web because it provides the perfect medium for potential business associates or job recruiters. And who doesn’t want a job?</p>
<h2>Building a Website</h2>
<p>So you’re convinced that you need one, but you’re not sure how to go about it? I’ve got you covered. There are a ton of different options for creating your own webpage, like Wordpress, Wix and a host of others. Those are all great, especially if you’re not especially tech savvy, but for the purposes of this article, I will assume you know the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>Knowing HTML/CSS is great, it makes you feel like you’re Neo seeing the matrix for the first time. However, we all know that plain HTML/CSS can be a hassle. Enter Bootstrap and Start Bootstrap. The former is a HTML/CSS framework created by Twitter’s developers that was released to the public some years back. It’s a godsend when you want to get something up and running that looks good without taking too much time to get it done. Start Bootstrap takes things one step further by providing some templates that make use of the Bootstrap framework.</p>
<p>Both of these resources are very easy to understand and make use of in a relatively short amount of time if you have a history with HTML/CSS. So hurry up and stop by their website, and get a quick and dirty version of your website put together. Once you’ve got something cobbled together, you’re ready for the next step — domain registry and hosting.</p>
<h2>Domain Registry and Hosting with Gandi and AWS</h2>
<p>There are just as many options for hosting a website as there are for creating one. For instance, Github offers a service called Github Pages that will serve one of your repositories up as a web page. This service is very easy to setup and use in a pinch, but it has a couple of drawbacks. One is that your page cannot run server-side code, meaning no (truly) dynamic content. The other is that your URL will have “.github.io” at the end of it. We’re shooting for a truly professional-looking site, so we’re going to pass on Github Pages this time.</p>
<p>Since a custom URL is a necessity, our only option is to register a domain. Of course, this isn’t free. A domain will typically cost you around ten dollars per year. If you’re serious about having a personal website like me however, this is peanuts.</p>
<p>Again, there are many options to choose from at this step. You have to register a domain with a, you guessed it, domain registrar. There are many opinions about who constitutes the best registrar, but almost all of them say that it is not GoDaddy. Therefore, I went with Gandi, and I’ve been very happy with my experience. If you’re looking for the easiest, most direct path forward, you should also choose Gandi. Plus, how could anyone go wrong with something only one letter off from Gandhi?</p>
<p>Whichever registrar you choose to go with, you’ll probably be pretty surprised at the sheer amount of different domain extensions there are to choose from. I know I was. There’s plenty of room for creativity here, just try not to go hog-wild. $600.00 is a bit much to spend on a domain at this point (unless you’re Google) and any future employers might not be impressed by a .ninja domain.</p>
<p>Once you’ve registered your domain, you’re ready for hosting. Your registrar probably provides hosting services, but I opted for Amazon Web Services instead. AWS is worthy of another post all to itself, but suffice to say that it is completely capable (and it’s free for the first year!) Dealing with it is also comparable to battling some sort of multi-headed-hydra-monster because of the ridiculous amount of services it encompasses and is much of the reason why I decided to make this post.</p>
<p>Okay, so for all my talk of monsters, AWS’s documentation is surprisingly easy to follow. Knowing which documentation to follow can be the difficult part, so that’s what I’ll help with. Here’s what you need to do:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go through the “Setting Up to Host a Static Website on AWS” tutorial. This tutorial runs you through creating your account and setting up some necessary preliminary system-admin-type stuff. It’s straightforward and easy to do.</li>
  <li>Next, “Create the Buckets for Your Website.”</li>
  <li>Now you need to “Deploy Your Website.” DANGER WILL ROBINSON, THE TUTORIAL IS INCORRECT. For whatever reason, under the “Set Up a Redirect” section, the tutorial has you redirect your second bucket to your equivalent of “example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com” Instead, redirect to your root domain e.g. “example.com” If you do it the way described in the tutorial, your URL will display in the oh-so-annoying “example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com” format, and you’ll probably have no idea why.</li>
  <li>Next, “Associate a Domain Name with Your Website.” Note that Amazon charges .50 cents per month for each Hosted Zone you maintain.</li>
  <li>You’re done! Go eat some cake, you’ve earned it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Whew, that was a lot of work! It’s very worth it though, as I’m sure you’ll find during your time as a webmaster (it’s a thing.) I hope you found this tutorial to be helpful, and that you have an optimally functioning website somewhere out there on the web. If you’d like to see more articles like this one, I post here on Medium every other Friday.</p>

            <section><h1>Me, Myself, I——An Introduction</h1>
<p class="date">May 27, 2016</p>
<p>Hey there, my name’s Morgan. Let me first start off by telling you a little about myself. I’m a (training) web developer currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp called the Viking Code School. I’ve had an interest in software engineering for quite a long time now, but I’m finally at a point where it makes sense to take the next step. While most of what I do these days consists of alt-tabbing between Hacker News and Emacs, during more “normal” times of my life I consider myself a dedicated movie fan, book reader and (sometimes) soccer player. As for the future, I have hopes of starting a company some day, but in the mean time I settle for concerning myself with all things “entrepreneur.”</p>
<p>On to the point of the post — I’ve been “learning to code” for quite a while now. I put that in quotes, because I mean the phrase loosely. You see, the first time I ever decided to learn to code was probably something like five or six years ago, when I was still in high school. I’d decided to start off with none other than Python. I made the obligatory hello-world program and some other basic ones, like a fibonacci number generator. I remember feeling elated at my newfound ability to write incantations, er, programs — It felt like magic, being able to get the computer to do work for me like that.</p>
<p>From there, I’d get the urge to “learn to code” again every year or so. As I’m sure some of you can relate, time and motivation weren’t always in abundance. It’s a fairly common trope on the internet that learning to program is hard, and it proved to be no different for me.</p>
<p>My most recent attempt has played out a little differently, however. Around February of this year I decided to get serious about this coding thing, and quit my job to focus on learning full-time. I knew that I wanted to attend a coding bootcamp, but costs were a definite factor for me. When I came across Viking Code School I knew it was my ideal candidate. VCS features deferred tuition until you get a job (like App Academy, if you’ve heard of it) and also remote-access, both of which are right up my alley.</p>
<p>For a few weeks, the only things on my mind were methods and iterators in preparation for the coding tests and interviews. As it turned out, I had prior experience with the required language, Ruby, so that was a plus. Stress became a factor, as I was sold and wanted to attend VCS very badly, but in the end I pulled through.</p>
<p>Which brings me to now. My cohort is set to begin July 5th, and I couldn’t be more excited to get started. Between the prep work I’ve been given and all the interesting material I’ve been covering on my own, I’ve been buried up to my ears in learning materials. I’ve discovered this incredibly interesting (family of) language(s) called Lisp and also a book titled the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. I’m especially excited about both of these, because for some reason or another, anytime they’re brought up in online discussions it’s done in the ‘net-equivalent of a reverential whisper.</p>
<p>So, that’s me. I intend to keep posting throughout my upcoming journey to become a web developer. VCS covers technologies like Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, and a couple of the newer JS frameworks, and I’m sure that I’ll be posting quite a few write-ups on these and other sorts of technical topics. So whether you’d like to follow along for the sake of your own education, or you’re just interested in what these newfangled “coding bootcamps” are all about — I intend to post about my adventures in this land-of-code every other Friday between now and the end of October. See you around!</p>

            <section><h1>Chess</h1>
<p class="date">March 1, 2016</p>
<p>I’ve recently re-tackled the Command Line Chess project at the end of the Learn Ruby track over at The Odin Project. Here’s [sic] the post that chronicled my first go at it in May of last year. On first glance, I thought it would be fairly straightforward, but as it turned out I underestimated the complexity of the ancient game. If memory serves (I was new to version control at the time, so no code) the checkmate? method is what derailed me. I had some weird side effects in my code that made me decide that it would probably be best if I just started back at the drawing board, but I ended up getting bored with it and moving onto something different. I’m happy to announce, however, that I’ve got my first working version up and running today!</p>
<p>I’ve yet to implement En Passant and Castling, but I’ve got the majority of basic functionality finished up. Which isn’t to say I haven’t had my fair share of problems with the little program, because I have. I’ve racked up a fair number of hours over the past few days to get the program to a place where I’d be happy with calling it “most of the way there.” Along the way, I’ve started to realize why things like Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming exist, because I’ve often completely or at least partially ignored their pleas of wisdom and paid the price. Essentially I just hacked away at the program and repeatedly ran and re-ran it in my terminal until finishing up whatever method I happened to be working on. And it got the program to where it is now, but not without a couple of headaches.</p>
<p>I think my biggest problem with my first attempt at the program last year was that I hadn’t much discipline with coding and often ignored some basic tenets of OOP, like maintaining methods without weird and unnatural side effects. Throwing things together haphazardly can work in the short term but it often compounds over time until your code starts to smell really bad. I’ve cut down on this habit enough this go around that it at least works, but I’m still not happy with the way my code looks. Frankly, it’s gross looking and smells like four day old tuna surprise, so I’m going to go back and refactor in a few days time.</p>
<p>However now that I feel that I’ve got a handle on Ruby, I’m going to begin learning some new topics of interest. You see I’ve decided to learn the bare minimum to get a decent looking portfolio website up and running. So that means Bootstrap for the CSS, and Javascript/jQuery for the client side functionality. I haven’t got any experience with Bootstrap, but from what I’ve seen in a couple of introductory videos, it’s fairly straightforward. As for Javascript and jQuery, I have a bare bones understanding that I’ll fill out over the next few days.</p>
<p>Once I have my site up, I want to port my newly finished Chess program over, wave my magic Javascript wand and hopefully get an in-browser, drag and drop version up and running. Even though I’ve done a lot of the heavy-logic oriented thinking (and what I assume is the majority of the work) in this initial version of chess, I’m most excited to get it into the browser because it will be my first taste of “user-friendly” software. Once I’ve got it finished, it’ll be accessible by anyone on the internet (thanks to Heroku) and will be simple enough to play (thanks to JS) that your grandmother could (hopefully) play it. Which is awesome, because it means I can share my work with essentially anyone, instead of bothering my brother with an ugly looking CLI chess program.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’m glad to be back posting on my blog.  I’m *really* glad to be back coding. I’ve missed Ruby and even more I’ve missed the feeling of cramming new knowledge into my head.</p>
<p>Here’s to not missing that feeling ever again.</p>
